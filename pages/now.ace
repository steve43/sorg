          p It's 2020. Like for almost everyone else on Earth, COVID-19 is top-of-mind. I'm working from home, San Francisco is sheltering in place, and the future is a hugely uncertain time.

          p As bad as our present day situation is, an indefinite work from home policy has given me more flexibility and more energy in my day-to-day than I've ever had in my adult life, and I'm going to do my best not to waste it.
          p Some things I’m working on:
          ul
            li
              | Write every day, and try to so fluidly. Instead of agonizing over every word, get content down, revise, and revise again. Some projects:
              ul
                li A (roughly) weekly newsletter called <em>Nanoglyph</em>. I’m challenging myself to send at least 30 editions in 2020, and do so without compromising content quality. You should <a href="https://nanoglyph-signup.brandur.org/">try subscribing</a>.
                li A development log with notes on daily software discoveries and projects. Most entries will be of minor interest, but frequent enough to build writing cadence. <a href="/fragments/google-cloud-run-deploy">For example</a>.
            li Meditate every day.

/   li Write more, and more fluidly. Instead of agonizing over every word, get content down, revise, and revise again.
/   li The craft of software has landed on a plateau where big, complicated, fragile backend deployments that support slow, underwhelming, buggy frontend products is the norm. Find techniques and ideas to reverse this trend and boost their signal.
/   li Ran 1000 miles and did 42k pushups in 2019, do so again in 2020. Keep weight at ~150 lbs. Zero in on ~10% body fat.
/   li Reboot meditation practice. Did pretty well in 2018, but fell off the wagon completely in 2019. Aim for a couple 30 consecutive day runs.

/   li Writing on topics like <del>WebSockets</del> (<a href="/live-reload">done</a>), operable databases, and stability through data constraints.
/   li Nutrition and fitness: Leaner diet, run 1000 miles in 2019. Targeting <150 lbs. and ~10% body fat.

/ li Some basic voice recording to help me get more articulate and be able to form more cohesive long form thoughts in speech.
